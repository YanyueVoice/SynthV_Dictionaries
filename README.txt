A collection of dictionaries for SynthV. More languages are planned but see below for what is currently available.

Mandarin
- Mandarin-to-Japanese (https://youtu.be/ZZvPI42XVZo)
- English-to-Mandarin (No Video Yet)

Issues
- Mandarin-to-Japanese is currently romaji only. Hiragana and katakana support is planned.
- English-to-Mandarin is currently pinyin only. Hanzi support is planned.

Usage Problems
- The Mandarin-to-Japanese dictionary vowels may have varying pronunciation (AiKO Lite pronounces [t e] and [th e] as [t 7] and [th 7], and some [e] samples turn into [e :\i]). This dictionary does not work well with Chiyu Lite but a seperate dictionary for her is planned.
- The English-to-Mandarin dictionary may have issues with semivowels ([y] and [w]) being too long, especially with Eleanor Forte Standard Lite, this can be adjusted in the Note Properties section.

Credit
If anyone actually uses these (they're not the best at the moment), credit does not need to be given, but you can if you wish to do so.
